# Star Rating Component

This is a simple, interactive star rating component built using React. The component allows users to:

. Hover over the stars to highlight them dynamically.
. Click on a star to set a permanent rating highlighting the corresponding stars.
. Reset the stars to their original state when hovering out, unless a rating has been selected.

Key features include hover effects, clickable ratings, and dynamic color changes using state management in React. Ideal for use in rating systems for products, reviews, or any feature requiring user feedback.
